/**
 * The placeholder copy the **M3 Wear OS Apps Design Kit** draws, so a Remote sticker and the kit
 * cell it is compared against say the same words.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `catalog.spec.json` points this catalog's `compareWith` at
 * [`wear-m3-catalog`](https://github.com/yschimke/wear-m3-catalog), which reproduces the published
 * kit, and the compare page now carries that kit's own artwork as a third column. So every sticker
 * here is read against a kit cell — and a filled button labelled "Filled" beside a kit cell
 * labelled "Primary label" is a difference reported on every button row. Those differences are
 * noise twice over: they bury the structural findings that matter (a wrong radius, a missing
 * border, a colour off by a token), and they are the *only* kind of difference this catalog can fix
 * without touching the component, because the kit is read-only.
 *
 * This is the same bargain the Wear sibling struck, and the constants are transcribed from its
 * `KitCopy` (`catalog/src/main/kotlin/ee/schimke/wearm3catalog/CatalogCopy.kt`) rather than re-read
 * off the kit, so the two catalogs cannot drift into quoting the same cell differently. It is a
 * duplicate because the sibling lives in another repository and publishes no artifact carrying
 * these strings; if that ever changes, depend on it instead of copying.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX. The Wear sibling notes that matching the words is most of what matches
 * the *outline*, because its stickers are cropped to what they draw. That does not carry over: a
 * Remote sticker rasterises the whole `@Preview` frame rather than being cropped to what it draws,
 * so changing a label moves the glyphs and nothing else. The framing question is separate — see the
 * multipreviews in `CatalogTheme.kt`, which is where it is addressed — and copy cannot fix it.
 *
 * Only the strings this catalog actually needs are here. Slots the kit publishes no copy for — the
 * button group's two halves, the watch-screen template's list rows — are deliberately absent: see
 * the call sites.
