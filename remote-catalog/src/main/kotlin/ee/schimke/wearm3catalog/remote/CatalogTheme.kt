/**
 * The catalog's Remote Compose **component** sticker frame: the remote content, centred inside a
 * full-size `RemoteBox`, built into a `RemoteDocument` and rasterised by the Remote Compose player
 * — the same byte-stream path a watch face / tile / widget takes on-device.
 * `RcPlatformProfiles.ANDROIDX` is the render profile the AndroidX tooling uses.
 *
 * Captures through the connector's [RemoteOverridablePreview] rather than raw upstream
 * `RemotePreview`. It keeps the `RemotePreview { … }`-inside-the-preview shape (Approach 1 in
 * `:samples:remotecompose` in yschimke/compose-ai-tools, so it renders today without the
 * `@PreviewWrapper` tooling annotation), but additionally (a) applies any
 * `renderNow.overrides.remoteCompose.namedValues` the daemon seeds — so the named-value stickers
 * ([ee.schimke.wearm3catalog.remote.NamedLabelRemoteButton],
 * [ee.schimke.wearm3catalog.remote.ShaderGradientSticker]) actually flip in trusted live
 * re-renders, matching what the spec/captions advertise — and (b) offers the captured
 * `RemoteDocument` into the bundle's `.rc` sidecar for replay. With no seeded overrides (the
 * vanilla `composePreviewRenderAll` and the weekly design-artifacts render) it is the same output
 * as plain `RemotePreview`.
 *
 * **The recorded documents are default-themed**, which is what lets a theme be applied to them
 * afterwards by overriding named values (`USER:WearM3.<role>`) — see `RemoteThemeCatalogs.kt`. That
 * falls out of how they are recorded rather than needing enforcement here:
 * `composePreviewRenderAll` renders each `@Preview` with no provider, so [LocalRemoteCatalogTheme]
 * is null and the branch below takes the un-themed path. A capture with a theme baked in would
 * carry that theme's colours as constants, so every theme would need its own capture and a
 * published catalog could only show the one it was packed with.
 *
 * The themed branch is for the other case: a **recomposing** session asked for `?themeProvider=`,
 * so the renderer wraps the preview in a provider and this installs the scheme for that render. It
 * reads the same [remoteCatalogThemeColors] map the replay path seeds, so the two lanes cannot
 * disagree about what a theme is.
 *
 * Every capture installs [RemoteCatalogTypography], including the un-themed path. That makes the
 * document ask for one exact Google Fonts family instead of emitting the stock `roboto-flex`
 * device-family id and trusting each player to resolve it the same way. Typeface is not named
 * state, so a replayed document cannot swap it with the colour overrides. Published captures keep
 * this baseline face; each theme's intended pairing remains player-lane data in
 * `RemoteThemeCatalogs.kt`.

 * same number, because both sheets reproduce the same kit.
 *
 * Two opposite faults meet here, and one modifier settles both
 * ([#138](https://github.com/yschimke/wear-m3-catalog/issues/138)):
 *
 * - A **card** fills the frame's measuring bound, which is 227dp wide — so it published at 227
 *   against a 172dp kit cell, 55dp too wide.
 * - A **button** wraps to its label, because Remote's `RemoteButton` sizes to content just as
 *   Wear's `Button` does — so it published at 122dp, 50dp too narrow.
 *
 * Neither is a comparator artifact: design-parity rasterises the reference to the CANDIDATE's
 * width, so a wrong width rescales the whole comparison rather than differing at an edge.
 *
 * Reach for this on a control the kit draws across its content column. A component that is
 * *supposed* to size to its content — an icon button, the compact button — must not take it.

/**
 * The catalog's Remote Compose **component** multipreview. A single 227×100 capture. Remote Compose
 * has no light/dark theme split of its own — the document carries explicit colours — so this is the
 * one primary mode. Those colours come from `RemoteMaterialTheme`, the dark-first Wear Compose
 * Material 3 scheme, so the one mode is **dark**: like the Wear stickers these rasterise onto
 * transparency (`showBackground = false`), and the content is light-on-nothing. The catalog is
 * tagged to match — `modes: ["dark"]` + `display.surface: "dark"` in `catalog.spec.json` — so the
 * preview server backs the sheet on a dark stage instead of washing a white `RemoteIcon` /
 * `RemoteText` out on the default white one.
 *
 * **The frame is component-shaped, and that is load-bearing.** It was 200×200 — a square, for
 * components that are mostly 150×52dp buttons — which published each sticker as ~15% content and
 * ~85% transparency, and handed the cross-system compare page a 1:1 capture to set beside a kit
 * cell that is 172×52. The comparison squashes one into the other's aspect before it diffs, so the
 * frame alone was a difference on every row. 227dp wide is the Wear canvas the `wear-m3-catalog`
 * sibling renders on (its device-less previews are retargeted to 227dp @ 2.0x), so a component that
 * fills its width — a card, a line of text — now measures the same as its parallel instead of being
 * stretched to an arbitrary 320. 100dp tall clears the tallest thing in this class (`IconRemote`,
 * at 76dp) with room to spare.
 *
 * Bump the height if a component needs more room than that — and check the render, because this
 * frame is a *measuring bound*: a width-filling component re-wraps when it changes, so a taller
 * frame is free but a narrower one is not.
 *
 * A component that positions itself against the display edge wants [CatalogRemoteDisplay] instead,
 * and one whose content IS the canvas wants [CatalogRemoteCanvas]: what decides is the shape of the
 * kit cell the render is compared against.
 *
 * The render density is declared here in the **preview configuration** rather than left to the
 * default (~2.625, a phone density). A Remote Compose document is authored for a target density,
 * and this catalog mirrors **Wear** Compose Material 3, so `dpi=320` pins it to **density 2.0** —
 * the scale every Wear render here is read at (`227dp → 454px`). A `spec:` device sets size +
 * density with no device frame, so the transparent centred-sticker contract is unchanged; #2760
 * stamps this density into the captured `.rc` so the player replays the dp-typed size modifiers at
 * the same scale.

 *
 * 200dp tall, against a measured tallest of 182dp (`AppCardRemote`, once it carries the kit's card

 * sibling fans its own templates across the kit's five round breakpoints (192–240dp) instead; this
 * sheet captures one canvas per sticker, so it pins the one size rather than the range.
 *
 * Unlike the component stickers, a screen template paints its own surface (see

 * wrapping its content.
 *
 * This is the Remote counterpart of the Wear sibling's `FullScreenSticker`, and what decides it is
 * the same thing: the SHAPE of the kit cell the render is compared against. The kit publishes its
 * indicators — the page indicators, the circular progress rail — as `192×192` *display* cells, the
 * round face whole, and `wear-m3-catalog` accordingly renders them 384×384 square where it renders
 * a button 272×136. A rail is a curve struck against the bezel: give it a squat component frame and
 * it does not merely sit in too much space, it lays itself out against the wrong edge and shrinks.
 * That is measurable — moving the interactive page indicator into a 227×100 frame collapsed it from
 * 8.2% of its capture to 1.6%.
 *
 * Distinct from [CatalogRemoteScreen], which is the same size for a different reason: a screen
 * template paints its own surface and IS the watch face, where these rasterise onto transparency
 * like every other component sticker.
