/**
 * The catalog's declared themes — five names in two groups, inherited unchanged from the `wear-m3`
 * harness catalog in yschimke/compose-ai-tools, which this sheet was paired against before the
 * move.
 *
 * They are NOT the sibling `:catalog`'s set: that one declares the Confetti Wear conference
 * palettes (`CatalogThemes.kt`). So the two Theme selects no longer read as one set, and pairing
 * them off is a follow-up rather than something this move should have changed — renaming a theme
 * renames the state a published document's overrides address, which is a change to the sheet, not
 * to its packaging.
 *
 * ## A theme can be applied after recording, not only during it
 *
 * This is the load-bearing difference from the Wear sibling. Every sticker is recorded **once,
 * under the default theme**, and a selected theme can then be applied to the already-recorded
 * document by overriding **named values** — no recomposition, and no per-theme capture.
 *
 * That works because `RemoteMaterialTheme`'s scheme is not constant-folded into the document. Each
 * role it draws through is emitted as named state — `USER:WearM3.primary`,
 * `USER:WearM3.surfaceContainer`, `USER:WearM3.onSurface`, and so on — and the player's
 * `setNamedColorOverride` reaches exactly those. Applying [remoteCatalogThemeColors] to a replayed
 * document therefore re-themes it with no recomposition:
 * ```
 * /render/button-filled__ideal__default__compact.png
 *     ?rc.WearM3.primary=color:%23FF6F61&rc.WearM3.onPrimary=color:%23210F48
 * ```
 *
 * returns a coral button from the *published* catalog, whose bytecode was dropped at pack time.
 *
 * Recording under the default theme is what makes that possible. A document captured with a theme
 * baked in would carry that theme's values as its constants, so every theme would need its own
 * capture and a published catalog could only ever show the one it was packed with. One
 * theme-independent document plus a small map of overrides replaces N documents.
 *
 * The recorded documents stay theme-independent because of *how* they are recorded, not because the
 * providers below do nothing: `composePreviewRenderAll` renders each `@Preview` with no provider,
 * so [LocalRemoteCatalogTheme] is null and nothing is installed. A provider is only ever applied
 * when the renderer deliberately wraps a preview in one — a `?themeProvider=` render on a session
 * that can recompose — and there it installs the scheme through [remoteCatalogColorScheme], reading
 * the same [remoteCatalogThemeColors] map the replay path seeds. One definition, two lanes: a theme
 * that recomposed to one palette and replayed to another would be worse than either, and nothing
 * would catch it, because both renders succeed.
 *
 * ## The typeface half is a host choice, not a named value
 *
 * A named value can carry a colour, a float, an int or a bool — not a face. The typeface is
 * host-side in a different way: the stickers emit the built-in **default family id**, and which
 * face that id resolves to is decided by the player at draw time. So [remoteCatalogFont] /
 * [remoteCatalogDisplayFont] are published here as data for that lane to configure its resolver
 * with, rather than being installed into the document. Until a lane does, a type-moving theme
 * (Google Sans Flex, KotlinConf) is declared and its colours apply while its face does not.
 *
 * Inter is not vendored yet, deliberately. A face only has to reach the `cmp-wasm-catalog`
 * `fonts.json` in yschimke/compose-ai-tools once a *document* names it — that lane is manifest-only
 * and never fetches, so an unlisted family a document asks for fails
 * `RcComposeSupport.fontFamilyIssue`'s availability check rather than degrading to a substitute. No
 * recorded document names it (recording is default-themed and the wrapper installs colours only),
 * so vendoring it now would add ~651 KB to the Wasm player's size ratchet to buy nothing — it
 * failed that ratchet once already on this branch. It lands with the lane that resolves it. Google
 * Sans Flex stays vendored: it was already there and the ratchet was already raised for it.
 *
 * ## What a theme deliberately does not reach
 *
 * The named-family stickers keep the exact faces they declare: [BrandedTextRemote],
 * [TypefaceSpecimenRemote], [VariableWeightRemote] and [VariableWidthRemote] are untouched under
 * every theme, because they exist to keep the named-family and font-variation-axis paths rendered
 * and diffed, and a theme that overrode them would delete the one place each capability is covered.
 *
 * ## A caveat on the synthesised specimen sheets
 *
 * `@WearThemeCatalog` also makes the renderer synthesise a specimen sheet per theme, read
 * reflectively off `androidx.wear.compose.material3.MaterialTheme` — a *phone/watch* Compose theme
 * these providers never install. Those five sheets are byte-identical to each other and are not
 * evidence of anything here; a sticker re-rendered under a seeded theme is.
