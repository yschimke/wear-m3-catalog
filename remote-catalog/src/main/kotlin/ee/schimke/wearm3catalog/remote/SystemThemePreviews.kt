/**
 * The catalog's coverage of the **second** Remote Compose colour-theming mechanism.
 *
 * A document can carry theming two unrelated ways, and until this sticker the published catalogs
 * only exercised one:
 * - **named colour state** (`USER:WearM3.<role>`) — a slot the host overwrites outright, which is
 *   what every themed sticker in [CatalogPreviews] uses and what a `themeProvider` request seeds
 *   into. 16 of the catalog's documents declare it.
 * - **`ColorTheme` operations** — a light and a dark colour captured *in the document*, which the
 *   player picks between from the requested theme. **No published document emitted one**, so
 *   everything downstream that reads it — `RcDocumentCapabilities`, and the replay-override routing
 *   built on it (compose-ai-tools#3936) — had only synthetic fixtures to test against.
 *
 * `homeassistant-remotecompose` now ships both: its Wear widgets take the named path and its
 * launcher widgets take this one, via Android's system theme resources. This sticker is the
 * catalog's copy of that second shape so the parity and capability work has a real document.
 *
 * The two are deliberately *not* interchangeable. A `ColorTheme` op holds its colours inline, so a
 * palette override has no slot to write into; it answers light/dark and nothing else. That
 * distinction is the one this sticker exists to keep honest.
 */
/**
 * A colour the **host** resolves from Android's system theme, written into the document as a
 * `ColorTheme` operation and referenced by id.
 *
 * Built without a constant value, and that is load-bearing. `BackgroundModifier` branches on
 * `hasConstantValue`: a colour carrying one is written as literal red/green/blue by
 * `SolidBackgroundModifier` and its id provider is never asked for. Subclassing
 * `RemoteColor(fallbackArgb)` and overriding `writeToDocument` therefore emits **no** `ColorTheme`
 * operation at all — the first two revisions of this sticker did exactly that, rendered three
 * correct-looking swatches, and produced a document with zero themed colours in it. The fallback
 * that wins is the light value a host without the resources would draw anyway, so the loss is
 * invisible in pixels and only the decoded document shows it. `homeassistant-remotecompose` shipped
 * the same mistake in its launcher palette (yschimke/homeassistant-remotecompose#573).
 *
 * The id-provider constructor and `RemoteConstantCacheKey` are `internal` upstream — there is no
 * public route to a document-written colour at `remote-compose` 1.0.0-alpha17 — hence the
 * file-level suppression.
