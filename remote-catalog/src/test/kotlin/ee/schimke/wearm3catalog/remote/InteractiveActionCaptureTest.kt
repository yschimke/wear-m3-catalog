/**
 * Guards that the clickable stickers encode a **self-contained** click — one the player can act on
 * by itself — rather than a `hostAction` that leaves the document unchanged.
 *
 * Every button and card on this sheet used to carry a shared `hostAction(...)` as its `onClick`.
 * That posts a payload *out* of the document and mutates nothing inside it, so a tap in the preview
 * player repainted nothing: there was no state change to repaint. The stickers now use
 * `countedRemote(...)`, which pairs a `rememberMutableRemoteInt` with a `valueChange` action and a
 * label expression conditional on that counter — so the player updates itself, no host round-trip.
 *
 * This has to be a **sidecar** assertion, not a pixel one, and that is the whole point: at rest the
 * counter is 0, so the conditional resolves to the bare label and the baked PNG is byte-identical
 * to the one this catalog has always published (that parity is the feature, not a gap). The counter
 * branch is only reachable once a player dispatches a real touch, which a static render never does.
 * The evidence therefore lives in the encoded document — where the branch's own string literals are
 * stored as UTF-8, exactly as [WidgetContainerIrCaptureTest] reads them.
 *
 * A regression that reverted a sticker to `hostAction` would drop those literals and fail here,
 * while the render stayed green.
