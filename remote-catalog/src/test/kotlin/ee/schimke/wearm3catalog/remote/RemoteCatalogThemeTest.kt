 *
 * Every sticker is captured under the default theme, so the document carries the stock scheme as
 * named state (`USER:WearM3.<role>`). A theme is then a map of overrides onto those names, which
 * the player's `setNamedColorOverride` applies with no recomposition — which is what lets a
 * *published* catalog, whose bytecode was dropped at pack time, still be re-themed.
 *
 * The keys are therefore load-bearing in a way ordinary constants are not: they have to match the
 * names the document actually emits, or the override silently no-ops and the render comes back
 * unthemed under a successful status.
