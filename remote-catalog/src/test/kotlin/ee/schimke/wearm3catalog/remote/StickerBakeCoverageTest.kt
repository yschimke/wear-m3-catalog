/**
 * Guards that no sticker in this sheet bakes to a **fully transparent** PNG.
 *
 * Why it needs its own test rather than being caught downstream: every parity lane that scores this
 * catalog flattens the baked capture and the player's render onto the same mid-grey before diffing
 * (the stickers are light content on transparency, so compositing over white would let them read as
 * identical to an empty canvas). A blank *reference* therefore flattens to the same pixels as a
 * player that drew nothing — the comparison is vacuous, and it scores a perfect 0.00%. `rc-compare`
 * now refuses to score such a row (#2933), which stops the false green, but that is the differ's
 * end: it reports the row as unscored and moves on. Nothing fails, and the catalog keeps shipping a
 * sticker with no pixels in it.
 *
 * This is that missing end. It fails the build instead, at the point where the capture is produced
 * — which is also the only place that can tell "this preview draws nothing" from "this preview was
 * never rendered".
 *
 * Alpha > 8 is the same threshold the differ uses for "opaque" (see
 * `scripts/design-artifacts/rc-compare-pixels.mjs`), so the two agree on what blank means.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* a minimum-coverage assertion: several stickers are legitimately sparse — a
 * one-word outlined button, a hairline card border, a single icon on a 200dp canvas all land under
 * 1% — and a floor tight enough to catch anything real would fail them. "Something was drawn" is
 * the invariant that holds for every sticker in the sheet.
