/**
 * Guards that the widget-container stickers carry their **encoded RemoteCompose document**, not
 * just pixels.
 *
 * Every other sticker in this sheet captures through `RemoteOverridablePreview`, which offers the
 * document to `IrSidecarChannel` so the render lands a `<stem>.rc` and `BundlePreviewTask
 * .resolvePreviewIr` packs it as the sticker's IR. The widget-container stickers went through
 * upstream's `WearWidgetPreview` instead, which captures the document internally and keeps the
 * bytes to itself — so they rendered fine while silently riding the bundle as compiled `@Preview`
 * bytecode. `CapturingWearWidgetPreview` closed that gap; this test is what keeps it closed.
 *
 * It is a *sidecar* assertion rather than a pixel one on purpose: the failure mode being guarded
 * against is invisible in the PNG. The capture is best-effort inside the composable (an IR failure
 * must not break the raster), so without this test a regression — a coroutines version skew, an
 * upstream signature change — would show up as nothing more than a missing file and a green build.
